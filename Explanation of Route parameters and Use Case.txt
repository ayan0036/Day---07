5. Short Explanation of Route Parameters and Use Case 
ANS:What are route parameters in Express.js? 

Route parameters are dynamic values written directly in the URL path. They are used to capture specific data like an ID. For example, in the route /student/:id, :id is a route parameter that can be accessed using req.params.id. This allows you to fetch details like a specific student from a list. 

*How are they different from query parameters? 

Route parameters are part of the path (like /student/2), while query parameters are added at the end with a ? (like /student?id=2). Route parameters are typically used when the value is required, and query parameters are used for optional filters.
